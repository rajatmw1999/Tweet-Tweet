# Tweet-Tweet

Tweet tweet is selenium-chrome driver driven twitter bot to make tweeting on https://twitter.com automatic. Just put your twitter account's username and password in the function params and run the pythno script to make 100,000 tweets through that twitter account!

Note: 100,000 tweets will take around 83000hrs :). If you want faster results, please implement multi-threading!
